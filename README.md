## The Open Source Data Science Masters: Capstone Projects

### What this is

A place for students of [The Open Source Data Science Masters](http://datasciencemasters.org/) to **find great Capstone Projects** and collaborators. 

*Anyone* with questions about data that is publically available can contribute by posting a Capstone Project!

### How you can help

- **Post a capstone project**!
- Work on a project with **teammates**, who you can find by posting in [`issues`](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/capstone/issues)

### How it works: Students

1. Find **a project** you like or create your own
2. Find **collaborators** by posting your interest and timeline in [`issues`](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/capstone/issues)!
3. **Data away!** (see the [OSDSM](http://datasciencemasters.org/))
4. **Post** your findings in the Capstone Project's .md file and link github repos with your work

### How it works: Posting a Capstone Project

Anyone can post an interesting data question as a capstone project by **sending a pull request** with a `.md` file. The file should include:
- a **Dataset** that is publically available
- a **Question** that is perceived to be possible to answer with the data^

^Note: The challenge here is in scope. The question cannot be too big, too small, too ill-fitted to the data (where no or little signal exists), but that may be unknown before the investigation. So hey, if it seems interesting and tractable, just go for it. If you have to write a why-this=didn't=work-thesis, so be it.
